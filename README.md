# Engage

The engage extension helps you find contacts based on their level of engagement.

It provides packaged searches available via the Search Menu:

  * **Engage Count Search**: Find contacts matching a count of activities of a given type and/or an average engagement index score.
  * **Participant Count Search**: Find contacts matching a count of events of a given type or participation status in which they have participated.

In addition there are some deprecated custom searches and reports that will be
removed in a future release.
